## Dataset 

### EPC database

The [Energy Performance of Buildings Register](https://find-energy-certificate.digital.communities.gov.uk/) (the register) is the official place for all Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), Display Energy Certificates (DECs) and Air Conditioning Inspection Reports (ACIRs).

The open data published on this website has been made available for data analysis to enable independent research into energy efficiency issues such as fuel poverty and climate change. The department has chosen only to publish data from 1 October 2008. The open data should not be relied upon to check if a valid EPC has been produced on sale or rent of a building, if a DEC has been produced for a public authority building over a certain size or if an ACIR has been produced for an air conditioning system.

### Data included in this site

-   **Domestic EPCs:** to 31 December 2021

-   **Non-Domestic EPCs:** to 31 December 2021

-   **Display Energy Certificates:** to 31 December 2021

On 20 September 2020 the register transitioned to www.gov.uk. All data before that date was provided from the Landmark register.

The EPC dataset is open and available on-line from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities - DLUHC (<https://epc.opendatacommunities.org/>). The EPC dataset used in this research is download in 23/03/2022. It contains 22,248,283 Domestic EPC, 1,035,588 Non-Domestic EPC and 435,371 Display Energy Certificates issued between 1/10/2008 and 31/12/2021.
